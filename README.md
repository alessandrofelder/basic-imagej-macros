# wallaby
ImageJ macros I used to accelerate opening, closing and saving of files for a semi-automated analysis of 2d images

The name is chosen because when I measure secondary osteons on lots of images, I sometime feel like a stoned wallaby making crop circles in a poppy field (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8118257.stm)
